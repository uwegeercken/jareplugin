<p><h2>Rule Engine Plugin</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
	The Rule Engine Plugin allows to run business rules against each row of data. For the maintenance of the business rules and actions the Business Rules Maintenance Tool - a web application - is used. Once the business logic is complete, the relevant project is exported from the tool in form of a zip file. The zip file is then referenced in the &quot;Rules File Name&quot; field.
</p>
<p>
	Note: make sure that inside the project in the Business Rules Maintenance Tool you define fields that correspond to the names of the fields in the transformation.
</p>
<p>
	The Business Rules Maintenance Tool can be downloaded as a Web Archive (war file) here:: <a href="https://github.com/uwegeercken/rule_maintenance_war">Business Rules Maintenance Tool</a>. The database MySQL/Mariadb database schema required by the tool is available here: <a href="https://github.com/uwegeercken/rule_maintenance_db">Business Rules Maintenance Tool</a>.
