Pentaho PDI Plugin Step for JARE - Java Rule Engine

Plugins for JaRE - Java Rule Engine - for Pentaho PDI (Kettle).

One plugin is for running the ruleengine inside Pentaho PDI. The other plugin is used when
the ruleengine runs in server mode on the same or a seperate machine. The plugin in this case
simply points to the server.

The steps now support metadata injection.
